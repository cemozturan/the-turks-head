    "Originated in the '70s as a take on the classic sour template of drinks",

  modalDescriptionTop: `Unfortunately, as the drink aged through the '80s and '90s, prefabricated artificial "sour mix" began to replace fresh lemon and sugar in high-volume bars across the globe.`,
  modalDescriptionBottom: `These mixers were especially detrimental to the Amaretto Sour, creating a double dose of sugar that led the cocktail to be associated with a super saccharine profile. Portland bartender and author, Jeffrey Morgenthaler, saved the drink's reputation by using fresh ingredients and adding in a cask-strength bourbon whiskey. Amaretto liqueur is too sweet and weak on its own, so the higher-strength whiskey adds proof, cutting back it's sweetness, whilst the fresh egg white adds a velvety texture.`,
